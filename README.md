Installation
------------
In case you wish to create your own module or contribute to the project, follow these steps to setup your enviroment.

First, install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) if you havent. npm is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with it.

Install Bower and Grunt,

    $> npm install -g bower grunt-cli
    $> npm update -b bower

Clone the repository.

    $> git clone https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT.git 

Now, lets install all the dependencies. Go into the root folder,

    $> cd SOCRAT
    $> npm install
    $> bower install

This will install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json and bower.json files.

Start the server! See the application running at localhost:9000!

    $> grunt serve
    
To start unit-test use. Status information will appear in the new browser window. Test runner will log into console.

    $> grunt test


Motivation 
--------------
[SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu), Statistics Online Computational Resource has a huge user base who constantly access the educational data present and java tools which use these data to aid in understanding statistics.
As far as the technology is concerned, currently all the applications are written in `java` and are presented as java applets. The reach of these applications is bottlenecked by technology.

Goal
------
The world is going the HTML5 way. Browsers are becoming more powerful. 
We intend to create a toolbox which will serve users on all platforms. We are primarily using `CoffeeScript` (compiles to `JavaScript`) for all the computations and presentation. Given the fact that todayâ€™s browsers have powerful javaScript engines (`v8`, `SpiderMonkey`), we perform all the calculations on the browser with no server dependency. File management, database, computation will be performed inside the browser.
